# HackerRank Problem Solving in C++/C

This repository contains my solutions to various problem-solving challenges on HackerRank, implemented in C++ (C++20, C++14, C++11) and C.  I will be regularly updating this repository with new solutions and improvements to existing ones.

## About

I'm using this repository to practice and improve my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency in C++ and C.  I aim to provide clear, concise, and efficient solutions to the HackerRank challenges I tackle.  I'll try to include comments where necessary to explain the logic behind my code.

## Structure

The repository is organized by HackerRank challenge domain or topic (where applicable).  Each problem has its own directory containing:

*   **`problem_name.cpp` / `problem_name.c`:** The source code solution.  The file name will indicate the language used (C++ or C).
*   **`README.md` (within the problem directory - optional):** A brief description of the problem, the approach used, and any relevant explanations or optimizations.
*   **`input.txt` (optional):** Example input used for testing.
*   **`output.txt` (optional):** Corresponding expected output for the example input.
